# About the data

## License

All OpenAlex data is made available under the [CC0 license](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). That means it's in the public domain, and free to use in any way you like. We appreciate attribution where it's convenient, but it's not at all necessary.

## Sources

OpenAlex is not doing this alone! Rather, we're aggregating and standardizing data from a whole bunch of other great projects, like a river fed by many tributaries. Our two most important data sources are [MAG](https://aka.ms/msracad) and [Crossref.](https://www.crossref.org) Other key sources include:

* [ORCID](https://orcid.org)
* [ROR](https://ror.org)
* [DOAJ](https://doaj.org)
* [Unpaywall](https://unpaywall.org)
* [Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov)
* [Pubmed Central](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/)
* [The ISSN International Centre](https://www.issn.org)
* Subject-area and institutional repositories from [arXiv](https://arxiv.org) to [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org) and everywhere in between



## Reporting bugs

OpenAlex is still very new, and so you'll probably encounter some bugs as you look through the data. Please report these by emailing us at **team@ourresearch.org.**
