### `x_concepts`

{% endhint %}

_List:_ The top concepts associated with the works hosted in this venue. We make this list by simply tallying up what percent of this venue's works are tagged any given concept...the more frequently a concept is found, the higher its score. We then apply a cutoff, so low-scoring concepts don't appear.

Each listed concept is an abridged Concept object, with one additional attribute:

* `score` (_Float_): The strength of association between this venue and this concept; `100` is the highest.

```json
x_concepts: [
    {
        id: "https://openalex.org/C86803240",
        wikidata: null,
        display_name: "Biology",
        level: 0,
        score: 86.7
    },
    {
        id: "https://openalex.org/C185592680",
        wikidata: null,
        display_name: "Chemistry",
        level: 0,
        score: 51.4
    },
    
    // and so forth...
]
```

### `counts_by_year`

_List:_ [`works_count`](concept.md#works\_count) and [`cited_by_count`](concept.md#cited\_by\_count) for each of the last ten years, binned by year. To put it another way: each year, you can see how many new works this venue started hosting, and how many times _any_ work in this venue got cited. **todo clarify**

```json
counts_by_year: [
    {
        year: 2021,
        works_count: 4211,
        cited_by_count: 120939
    },
    {
        year: 2020,
    works_count: 4363,
    cited_by_count: 119531
    },
    
    // and so forth....
]
```



### `works_api_url`

_String:_ An URL that will get you a list of all this author's works.

We express this as an API URL (instead of just listing the works themselves) because sometimes an author's publication list is too long to reasonably fit into a single author object.

```json
works_api_url: "https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=author.id:A2208157607",
```



### `updated_date`

_String:_ The last time anything in this author object changed, expressed as an [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO\_8601) date string. This date is updated for _any change at all_, including increases in various counts.

```json
updated_date: "2016-06-24T00:00:00"
```
