### `counts_by_year`

_List:_ The values of [`works_count`](concept.md#works\_count) and [`cited_by_count`](concept.md#cited\_by\_count) for _each_ of the last ten years, binned by year. To put it another way: for every listed year, you can see how many new works were tagged with this concept, and how many times _any_ work tagged with this concept got cited.

```json
counts_by_year: [
    {
        year: 2021,
        works_count: 4211,

    // and so forth....
]
```



### `works_api_url`

_String:_ An URL that will get you a list of all the works tagged with this concept.

We express this as an API URL (instead of just listing the works themselves) because there might be millions of works tagged with this concept, and that's too many to fit here.

```json
works_api_url: "https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=concept.id:C2778407487"
```

### `updated_date`

_String:_ The last time anything in this concept object changed, expressed as an [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO\_8601) date string. This date is updated for _any change at all_, including increases in various counts.
