description: Explore OpenAlex without needing to write code

# Website

{% hint style="info" %}
The website launches in late January 2022
{% endhint %}

The easiest way to explore the OpenAlex dataset is via the web interface. It allows you to search, filter, facet, and export OpenAlex entities, just like [the API](api/) does (in fact, it's built on our API), but without needing any technical knowledge.

There's only one downside to the website: it's not actually done yet :).&#x20;

In the meantime, there is a very basic webpage for each OpenAlex entity that you can view by following any OpenAlex ID. So for example, pasting this ID in your browser:

[https://openalex.org/W2741809807](https://openalex.org/W2741809807)

will take you to a webpage with the basic info we know about the entity.
