# Website

The easiest way to explore the OpenAlex dataset is via the web interface. It allows you to search, filter, facet, and export OpenAlex entities, just like [the API](api/) does (in fact, it's built on our API), but without needing any technical knowledge.

There's only one downside to the website: it's not actually done yet :). We're planning to launch the website in late January 2022.

If you'd like to be notified of when it launches, please [join our mailing list](http://eepurl.com/hA8PhL).&#x20;
